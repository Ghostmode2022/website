There is sooooo much confusion about cryotherapy and thermotherapy instead of being rational, cheap self-treatment options with minimal risks.
Roughly ice is for injuries, and heat is for muscles.
Ice is for injuries — calming down damaged superficial tissues that are inflamed, red, hot and swollen. The inflammatory process is a healthy, normal, natural process … that also happens to be incredibly painful and more biologically stubborn than it needs to be. Icing is mostly just a mild, drug-less way of dulling the pain of inflammation.
Heat is for muscles, chronic pain, and stress — taking the edge off the pain of whole muscle spasms and trigger points, or conditions that are often dominated by them, like back pain and neck pain), for soothing the nervous system and the mind (stress and fear are major factors in many chronic pain problems, of course).
